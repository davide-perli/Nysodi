## 2D Single Player Rust Game

Welcome to your next favorite 2D single player game, built in Rust!  
This project leverages the power of the [Fyrox](https://fyrox.rs/) game engine for smooth 2D gameplay, dynamic entities, and a robust scripting system.

---

### üöÄ Features

- **Single Player Action:** Control your player in a vibrant 2D world.
- **Dynamic Enemies:** Skeleton bots spawn every 10 seconds‚Äîdefeat them to increase your score!
- **Health System:** Take damage, heal with hearts, and watch your health bar update in real time.
- **Power-Ups & Hazards:** Collect hearts to heal, but watch out for bombs, since they can turn the game around by dealing tons of damage or the fire!
- **Game Over & Restart:** Lose all your health? Instantly restart or exit with a keypress.
- **Smooth Controls:** Move with WASD or arrow keys, use Space to take damage (for testing), R to restart, and Esc to exit.

### üß© Gameplay Overview

- **Enemies:** Skeleton bots spawn periodically and become visible at the center of the map.
- **Health:** Your player starts with 100 health. When health drops below 50, a heart appears‚Äîcollect it to restore health.
- **Items:** Bombs spawn every 30 seconds. Catch them to deal damage to bots depending on radius! Fire spawns every 30 seconds, deals damage to all bots on the map for a period of time!
- **Game Over:** If health reaches zero, the game displays a message and waits for your input to restart or quit.

## User stories and acceptance criteria

### SCRUM-1 User walks around a map  

### Description

As a player I can walk around a map in all directions, being bounded by some limits that have collisions enabled.  

### Acceptance criteria  
- The player can move the character up, down, left, and right using input controls.  
- The character stops moving when colliding with obstacles.  
- The character cannot move outside the defined map boundaries.

### Implementation details
The border is formed out of CenterTiles which contain Collider 2D items, initially also including 2D Rectangle Sprites, which were later removed after the SCRUM in which the map was designed, in order for the player to still be limited to a certain area with colliders made invisible.
